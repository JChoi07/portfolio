				<h3 class="works-header">Overview</h3>
				<p>Ventura Future was a cultural institution that held curated events to showcase the latest developments in contemporary design. Placing an emphasis to promote new and motivated designers, this event was hosted every year as part of Milan’s annual design week. With this institution as our client for this project, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">our team was tasked with creating graphic and digital assets that would be used throughout the event.</span></p>

			<section id="analysis" class="text-section">
				<h3 class="works-header">Analysis of Dan Friedman</h3>
				<p>Before beginning on both graphic and digital assets, the team first began with a deep dive on a precedent designer in Dan Friedman for inspiration. Through a thorough investigation of his works and philosphy as a Radical Mondernist, 4 key design principles were extracted that we would use as motivation for our own work. <a href="resources/Dan-Friedman-Week-01.pdf" target="_blank">Click me for the presentation!</a></p>

				<p class="paragraph-1">Upon researching the event of Ventura Future, the team settled on posters, totebags and sketchbooks for graphical assets as they helped in promoting the event and reflecting its nature to feature/develop emerging desginers. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">Through multiple graphic explorations, a final direction was chosen that featured reversible figure ground motifs created with varying scale and orientation of type.</span></p>

				<p class="paragraph-2">This direction featured a system that categorized each different theme of the event (food, academies, craftsmanship, and technology) with separate colours that were used to fill in spaces within the enlargened type. The remaining negative spaces would then feature important information regarding the event.</p>

				<h3 class="works-header">Microsite Implementation</h3>
				<p>When researching and taking into consideration the scope of how/what users would interact with the microsite, it was decided that the <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">focus would be using it as a platform to promote the event for prospective designers.</span> This was done as the event itself relies on incoming applications for it to be run; <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">without designers, there is no Ventura Future.</span> Thus, the site acts as a pre-purchase touchpoint detailing the benefits applying designers will receive using data from the previous year’s event.</p>

				<h5 class="works-header">Developing the Form</h5>
				<p class="paragraph-1">While we first aimed to translate the structure in our graphic assets to digital, it became clear as time progressed that this was not possible; a pivot in our approach had to be made. For this new platform, the key principles of reversible figure ground and energy through scale and orientation was maintained with previous elements being dropped.</p>
				<p class="paragraph-2">The site itself is an infinite scroll that leads the user through content regarding Ventura Future before reaching the end where they will be prompted to register for the event.</p>

				<h3 class="works-header">My Final Thoughts</h3>
				<p>Through these hectic 5 weeks, there was definitely a lot to take away through the studying, research and final development phases of the project. Being able to learn through the works of Dan Friedman revealed the intracies behind his vision of Radical Modernism and how key design principles can truly frame and drive an art direction. By fully understanding how and why these principles are implemented, we as designers can create better assets that speak to different contexts. In our case, we as a team discovered that <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">while graphic fundamentals are important to interaction design, the translation between both is not a simple one-to-one equation.</span></p>
