					<p>Serving as Riot Games first league in 2013, the LCS had established itself as a premier and storied competitive space that had grown the eSports scene garnering many fans.</p>

					<p>In recent years however, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">fan sentiment has shifted</span> with many expressing their discontent with the league's "boring product" with viewership staggering as a result: <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">From 2017 to 2022 the average viewership dropped from 150,254 viewers in 2017 to 123,144 in 2022 (Esports Charts).</span> The President of E-Sports at Riot Games acknowledged this viewership drop indicating it was a goal to address this decline.</p>

					<p>Through secondary research, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">it became evident that this drop in viewership can be attributed to a lack of interest in the current teams within the LCS</span> through a survey conducted by eSports journalist Travis Gafford (2021). <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">These findings highlight</span> that similarly to traditional sports, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">narratives and attachment to teams and players play a crucial role in sustaining fan engagement with the sport.</span> </p>

					<h5 class="works-subheader under-header text-2">Framing the Approach</h5>
					<p class="paragraph-1">Jumping off these insights, further research was conducted within the space of fandoms in order to better understand how individuals interact within the space directly in the LCS and other entities. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">A big challenge within the team came in breaking down what was meant by "fandom" and how it could be measured</span> as without this clarified, we knew whatever we created wouldn't have any staying power.</p>

					<p class="paragraph-2">Through looking at parallel spaces (i.e sports, eSports, music, KPop, etc), definitions were established for the questions of "What is fandom/why do people join fandoms", "How do people interact with fandoms" (i.e support the space) and "How can we faciliate the growth of fandoms".</p>

				<section class="text-section">
					<p class="paragraph-2">Follow-up primary research via an initial Sprint with 5 current and former LCS viewers revealed consistent findings as the importance of narratives, connecting others over moments and —something not originally revealed— self-improvement were highlighted; without these elements, disengagement is developed.</p>

					<p class="paragraph-2">This all served to inform our framing of <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">"How might we encourage disengaged fans to interact with LCS gameplay and support key teams and players throughout the watching experience?"</span></p>

					<h3 class="works-header">My Final Thoughts</h3>
					<p>There is a lot to say with this entire journey... trust me there is. I'll try to keep it short though. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">Coming into this directed studies, I didn't think I'd have a chance to dive into this client which had previously just been a passion project pipe dream; getting people onboard even was not easy.</span> Having a chance to apply what I had learned from previous experience design projects into this however, was everything I could have asked for.</p>

					<p><span class="semi-bold-orange-text">Being able to work on a project at this length was not only fun but further showed me the value that comes in the details.</span> The end was successful, but it only was possible from from the extensive background research, deep dive into Riot + the LCS as a company and the multiple user testing sessions. While not every project will have this luxury of time as even this one had to drop things due to constraints, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text"> I know that —incoming cheese alert— as long as there is an idea to start.... with the right framing and approach, anything is possible.</span></p>

					<p>As a final send-off, thanks again to the entire team + everyone that helped along the way and for putting up with any eSports-related jokes I had.</p>
