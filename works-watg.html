					<h3 class="works-header">Overview</h3>
					<p>Wool and the Gang (WATG) is a global DIY fashion platform that strives to reinvent the crafting experience by offering the next generation of knitters the supplies and tools needed to knit customizable pieces. <span class ="semi-bold-orange-text">While WATG's emphasis on forward knitting has drawn many into the ecosystem, the craft itself remains a difficult hobby to grasp which leads many to drop it all together and leave the space.</span></p>

					<p>Untangled is thus a proposal for a supplmentary app designed to help beginner knitters overcome the struggles of knitting and empower them to continue the craft with WATG. <a href="#watg-intervention">Click me</a> to see the intervention.</p>

					<p>When looking at WATG from a brand and business perspective research, it became evident that a large emphasis was placed on promoting the craft of knitting and pushing it beyond the established (and somewhat stereotypical) connotations.<span class="semi-bold-orange-text"> 4 key brand pillars were surfaced to represent their approach based on their offerings and identity.</span></p>

					<h5 class="works-subheader">Framing the Approach</h5>
					<p class="paragraph-1">Taking these considerations into mind, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">follow up primary research was conducted via a survey (with 147 respondents) and a Sprint (with 7 beginner to novice knitters)</span> to better understand how individuals approached the knitting process and what they needed to be supported.</p>

					<p class="paragraph-2">A consistent finding that resonated with both parties was <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">that a large motivation for knitting was spurred by a desire to knit a specific garment.</span></p>

					<div class="pull-quote">
						<h3 class="principle-number">“</h3>
						<h4 class="questions-name">Mostly if the pattern is repetitive or doesn’t knit up fast I’ll get demotivated and put the project down for months. I tend to just wait a while and see if I ever fall back in love with the pattern.” </h4>

						<p class="question-quote"> – Survey Respondent</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section class="text-section">
					<p class="paragraph-1">In this journey to create their desired garment however, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">many beginner knitters found themselves struggling to approach this process as 33.6% of the survey respondents noted that their issues were pattern related.</span> Despite issues with the traditionally dense written patterns, user feedback revealed that this was still the primary means for knitters to approach projects; especially with WATG that used them in their beginner kits.</p>

					<!-- <p class="paragraph-2">With this in mind, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">our team focused on how we could help beginner knitters overcome the cognitive overhead in understanding the techniques and avoid extensive troubleshooting so they can continue projects and be motivated to start new ones.</span></p> -->

					<p>Leveraging the brand pillars of Make it Fashionable, Knitwork Knowledge and Gang Related Activity, we thus proposed a framing of <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">"How might we provide beginner knitters with resources that help them learn to knit as they work through a pattern?"</span></p>

				</section>

				<div class="list">
					<ol class="content-list-parent">
						<li class="content-list-child">A mobile device allows for more flexibility as knitters wouldn't always have their desktop on hand</li>

					<h3 class="works-header">My Final Thoughts</h3>
					<p>As my first endeavour into the realm of Experience Design, there was a lot of pain and struggles to not only understand what this concept meant, but how such work could be executed. The process alone of landing on a client through deep and wide research and understanding when to drop a weaker one (with no clear business connotations) served to be a test for my understanding of what design process entailed; <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">if it's garbage in, sadly it's often garbage out.</span></p>

					<p><span class="semi-bold-orange-text">This project also was the first time I worked in a group environment where the roles within the team were specifically delegated based on our individual skillsets.</span> Although I was skeptical for the approach, by the time things were truly settled in the 3rd to 4th week, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">I'm glad we went with this approach as we were a well oiled design team by the end of it.</span></p> 
					<p>I can't imagine having done this project with another team after everything we went through, so here's my first (of many to come in the future) thanks here!</p>
