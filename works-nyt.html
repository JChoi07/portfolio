					</div>

					<p>While being known for their print based content, NYT in recent years have placed a heavy emphasis on their digital subscription growth. Through brand and business secondary research, it was surfaced that they set a goal of hitting 15 million digital subscribers by 2027.</p>

					<p>Although NYT have increased their subscriber count exponentially, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">their growth has stagnated as they have become the most cancelled digital newspaper service.</span> This increase was driven by their promotional offerings that had brought readers in, but past this discounted period, <span class = "semi-bold-orange-text">readers cancelled their subscriptions due to a perceived lack of time which did not match what they were willing to pay. </span></p>

					<h5 class="works-subheader">Framing the Approach</h5>
					<p class="paragraph-1">Through these insights from the survey, a follow-up interviews with 7 individuals was conducted through the team's Sprint to understand the behaviours surrounding news consumption. It became evident from these two streams that a large issue came in the fact that <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">occassional readers of the New York Times could not maximize their subscription as they lacked the time to read read in-depth articles during the day.</span></p>

					<p class="paragraph-2">This informed our framing of <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">"How might we help an occassional reader form a routine to integrate daily news consumption into their day to day lives?"</span></p>

					<h3 class="works-header">My Final Thoughts</h3>
					<p>As a second go around in the realm of Experience Design (with Wool and the Gang being the first), there was a lot to take away and consider. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">Heading into this 7 week process, our team had only really begun landing with NYT after the 3rd week as time before had been spent investigating other clients that fell through as the business problem's were not clear.</span></p>

					<p>Through a series of painful setbacks and —dare I say— pivots, myself and the rest of the team began to truly grasp the significance of business considerations with NYT and how such insights can drive a project; <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">making something desirable is just one half of the equation as an intervention (often) starts with the tangible values around.</span> Having gone through everything, I know even better the importance of starting from grounded + solid research and (sadly) when to move on from an idea.</p>

					<p>Last, but not least, here's one more final thanks to the entire team that went through this journey with me!</p>
