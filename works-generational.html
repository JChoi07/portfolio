					<h3 class="works-header">Overview</h3>
					<p><span class="semi-bold-orange-text">The Generational Library is a proposed community/cultural organization that aims to faciliate and redefine intergenerational relationships as part of an exercise to consider a reality with new world values to encourage new kinds of understandings.</span> In this redefined realm, the libary acts as a physical space for people of all ages to "check out" human books, participate in activities (i.e cooking or drawing) and engage in conversations</p>

					<p>In order to help our audience better imagine what this concept could look like, a website and collection of physical assets were created to convey the different touchpoints people may have with the library. <a href="#generational-intervention">Click me</a> to see the intervention.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="analysis" class="text-section">
					<h3 class="works-header">Concept Ideation and Research</h3>
					<p>To begin this speculative design process, our team was first tasked with researching a contemporary issue that interested us to see how we could use design as a tool to challenge established preconeived notions. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text"> Based on our groups shared passion for intergenerational relationships, we chose to explore this realm.</span></p> 
					<p>One aspect that stood out for us is that while (as current university students) we rarely interact with those outside our group,  we had all come to cherish and value the relationships we had as children with our grandparents, aunts, uncles and other family friends of all ages in our past. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">With this project, we thus aimed to uncover ways and surface understandings for how these same intergenerational relationships can be emulated with those outside our family.</span></p>

					<h5 class="works-header">The Importance of Intergenerational Relationships</h5>
					<!-- <p>While our own experiences with intergenerational relationships had come from a positive background, we seeked to understand just how much these experiencse affected both the young and old alike.</p> -->

					<p><span class="semi-bold-orange-text">Through our initial research, it became clear that intergenerational relationships served to create a foundation for success in early life and is a key to future happiness and well-being.</span> The Youth and Elderly in particular were seen to be the ones that were most likely impacted due to financial, emotional, mental and physical limitations as well.</p>

					<h5 class="works-header">Surfacing the Invisibles</h5>
					<p>In order to gain a better understanding for what prevents intergenerational relationships from existing, we analyzed our research to uncover what invisble social structures helped keep this issue in place. Three key factors and it's consequences were surfaced that formed the problematic cycle.</p>

						<figcaption class="img-caption">The Invisibles of the Issue</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Taking into account these invisibles, we investigated the possible areas of intervention we could explore. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">To faciliate this process, we dove back into our research and developed a series of leading questions that would be used to frame our approach.</span> After a rapid brainstorming session where we generated as many leading questions as possible, we grouped all of our queries before finalizing on our main 4.</p>

					</figure>

					<h5 class="works-header">Our Critique and Framing</h5>
					<p>With our invisibles, leading questions and background research in mind, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">we took a final step back to affirm what our exploration hoped to uncover; our "if so, then what"?</span></p>

					<p>Considering the barriers for generational relationships (due to hyperindividualism and advances in technology) despite our innate human social characteristics, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">we formed the framing below hoping to explore how the sharing of personal experiences and knowledge can be a facilitator for stronger communal bonds.</span></p>

					<p class="paragraph-1">When conceptualizing Generational Libraries, we imagined it would be a in-person space acting as a natural evolution of existing libraries (that tradionally changes based on public needs) with physical and digital touchpoints as a way to facilitate interactions. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">In order to visualize this layout, an <a href="img/generational-user-flow.png" target="blank">offerings flow</a> for both realms was created by myself and then iterated on with the rest of the team.</span></p>

					<p class="paragraph-1">To establish the visual tone for both the digital and physical assets, we aimed to stay true to the core themes of the library: a casual, safe haven that anyone can go to. As we imagined that these spaces (in such a world) will be we a common place to go for recreation and informative needs, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">we took special care to represent this harmonious weaving of generations.</span></p>

					<p class="paragraph-2"><span class="semi-bold-orange-text">This was done through type</span> as we chose an analog yet futuristic inspired header font in "Unnamed" to express the bond of the young and  old. A simple sans-serif in "Basic Commercial LT Com" was selected as a pair to ensure there is legibility for all audience members.</p>

					<p class="paragraph-2"><span class="semi-bold-orange-text">For colour,</span> we utilized a neutral pallette with accents of neon yellow and blue to communicate energy, brightness and youth. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">Finally, a textured layer</span> (inspired by printed catalogues) was incorporated as a means to display the authenticity of the different people and experiences within the library.</p>

					<h3 class="works-header">My Final Thoughts</h3>
					<p>Having come into this course with no real understanding of what "Speculative Design" truly meant, the process was —to say the least— confusing. Despite this, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">the project has not only given me a new perspective</span> on how to approach design as a whole, but also how I view the world; <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">there are invisibles everywhere that hold things in place and it's part of our duty as designers and people to seek them out.</span></p>

					<p>I can wholeheartedly say the 7 weeks of this project was not only an eye opening experience, but a heart warming one too as it was a joy to be able to work with this team and share ideas and conversations about this topic together.
