				<h3 class="works-header">Overview</h3>
				<p>Twitch is a platform that provides a place for a diverse array of creators and viewers to connect through the medium of streaming. With this brand as my client, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">I took on the responsibility of revamping/implementing a feature to improve how the user interacted with the Twitch application through brand and user research.</span></p>
				<p>Twitch Clips page is thus a proposed feature that aims to help extend the user's app experience when their followed streamers aren't online by presenting a dedicated space for them to quickly view stream moments. Reachable through the navigation bar acting as a separate page, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">this feature reinforces the defining aspect of Twitch by providing users with another way to see and connect with their content creators.</span></p>
			</section>
		
			<section id="brand-and-user-research" class="text-section">
				<h3 class="works-header">Brand and User Research</h3>
				<p>To gain a better understanding of Twitch and how individuals valued the platform, an investigation was conducted within the mobile app, Twitch's brand guidelines, and through user surveys and interviews. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">A consistent finding from all these research avenues was the emphasis placed on the connection between viewers and content creators.</span> The importance of this aspect was expressed by users as many believed that this was a defining aspect of the platform.</p>

				<p>These outlooks from the evaluative survey was further reinforced following user interviews as the data from both findings were used to develop a user journey map.

				<h3 class="works-header">Using Clips</h3>
				<p>While looking for ways to further the user's experience, clips arose as a prime candidate as this existing feature was brought up on multiple occasions during interviews and surveys. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">For viewers, it was valuable to be able to use these short snippets (clips) to catch up when you can't view the streamer live and to experience the most exciting moments of the stream. Despite the perceived importance of clips, however, it is not currently being displayed as a main feature within the Twitch app.</span></p>
				<p>This revelation along with the other gathered insights, provided me with the space to propose my feature intervention in the form of the Twitch Clips page: A new way to experience your favourite streamers.</p>

				<div class="example-information-left">
					<h6 class="works-subheader">Clips Currently</h6>
					<p class="annotations"> <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">As it stands, clips are placed as a carousel at the bottom of the discovery page meaning it is not easily accessible.</span> By creating a dedicated space for clips that is more apparent, users will be able to quickly view stream moments and stay in touch with their content creators.</p>

				<figure class="example-image-right">

			<section id="implementing-design" class="text-section">
				<h3 class="works-header">Implementing the Design</h3>
				<p class="paragraph-1"><span class="semi-bold-orange-text">In order to develop a dedicated space for clips, a few things were kept in mind: Being able to provide easy access to the page, showcasing a variety of content from followed streamers, and keeping true to the design patterns already established by Twitch.</span> The last aspect was particularly important as if I wasn't able to maintain what was expected, then this feature —no matter how effective it is— may not even be considered by users as it isn't "Twitch".</p>

				<p>By considering these key points, the final result was a complete feature that respected the existing features of Twitch, which would allow users to extend their app experience even when their followed streamers are offline.</p>

				<h3 class="works-header">My Final Thoughts</h3>
				<p>In the span of 3 weeks, there was a lot to take away and consider. <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">Being able to work with an established brand in a realm that I had always found interesting (video/streaming) was a fun experience and further reinforced the idea of design systems, art direction/content strategy and respecting what exists.</span> Through my own exploration of Twitch, I now know without a doubt that there are many intricacies and choices that go into establishing a brand and no matter how small something may be, it is done for a reason.</p>

				<p>Beyond being able to work with a brand, <span class="semi-bold-orange-text">this project also strengthened my understanding of why a good research background is needed for a good follow-up design.</span> Being able to talk and communicate with many users was critically insightful and the project wouldn't have ended up where it was without this process.</p> 

				<!-- <p>As a final, final note, I now see that different tools are necessary depending on the project at hand. Although Figma has been a simple go-to prototype tool, there were some interactions that were not possible due to the technical limitations. With this in mind, I look forward to seeing what other tools are out there.</p> -->
